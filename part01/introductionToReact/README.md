## create-react-app

- The easiest way is [Vite]

```bash
npm create vite@latest part1 --template react
cd part1
npm install

```

## [Component](./part1/src/App.jsx)


## [JSX]

>JSX is "XML-like", which means that every tag needs to be closed. 


## multiple components

>Indeed, a core philosophy of React is composing applications from many specialized reusable components.
